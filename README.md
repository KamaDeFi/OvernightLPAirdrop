# Instructions

Run this command:

```shell
pip install web3
```

Then modify `airdrop.py` as per the instructions at the top of that file to add the necessary addresses.

Make sure that the address that holds the LP tokens which will perform the airdrop has enough BNB gas (it will create one transaction per transfer).

Then run the aidrop script:

```shell
python3 airdrop.py
```
